    <h1>Melee Progression Guide</h1>
    <p class = "mainbox">Welcome to the Melee Progression Guide! This class is extremely tanky, capable of gaining extremely high defence, at the expense of the progress at the beginning of the game can be difficult, with a lack of range against the early bosses. However, this pays off, as some of the most well-known powerful weapons in the game are melee, so the game becomes very interesting in the latter stages.</p>
